# The most interesting thing from this class has been the implementation of NLTK. Using it with
# in the project for the second assignment allowed me to apply natural langauge recognition to
# a real text. Doing it with tweets was a lot more interesting and useful because the analysis
# was of more direct and straightforward texts as opposed to satire. Nonetheless, the tools in
# that package and the other text-mining activities were the most applicable. I found that using
# them made a leap from general problem solving style coding to data analytics, which interests
# me more.
